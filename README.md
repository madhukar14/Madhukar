Some of the challenges i faced:

1. Figuring out how to integrate spotify web api with the spotify SDK.
2. Figuring out the retro fit usage
3. Figuring out the query pattern that spotify supports and the format in which the data is returned (data returned is not JSON).
4. Biggest effort was to figure out that the spotify SDK cannot be used in eclipse since the library is not a JAR but is a .AAR file.
5. Getting started with Android Studio. It is really buggy.
6. rating key store and getting the .apk file for the app. It is not direct as it is in eclipse. We have to release the app with a key store and then only it generates a usable apk

As a by product of the app creation i found that, if the Android SDK is the latest version ie, 24.0.2 then even the ADT has to be updated to 24.0.2 which isn't released yet. But the patch is available which is mentioned below.

Altogether i throughly enjoyed coding for the app. I took 2.5 days to complete it. But effectively i took 10 hrs by providing 3 hrs per day.
